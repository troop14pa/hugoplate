Greetings, and welcome to Troop 14's Web site! Our Troop has a long, rich history. We're over 60 years old, and we're proud of our record of provding continuous service to the youth of the Palo Alto-Mt. View-Los Altos area. We're grateful to Covenant Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto for their generous sponsorship throughout this half-century plus.

If you're a potential Troop 14 Scout, you probably want to know the kinds of fun things we do. Let me give you a taste of all these.

### For Potential Scouts

The most important thing about Troop 14 is that we have fun. We go car camping, hiking, and backpacking. We take canoe trips and white water rafting trips, and we spend a weekend aboard a ship (for example, the USS Pampanito, and the USS Hornet). We go skiing, and we go winter camping. Some of our trips are short, some are long; some are easy—good for new Scouts—some are tougher, high-adventure trips—good for older Scouts.

Each year, we go to Camp Oljato for a week. Oljato is on a beautiful lake in the Sierra Nevadas. Scouts get a chance to go swimming, sailing, boating, canoeing, and hiking. They can earn merit badges and work on a new rank. Some do some target rifle shooting, or some shotgun shooting, or archery.

In short, we're a year-round troop.

What will you learn in Troop 14? Here's a sample:

* How to use a knife safely.
* Make a campfire, and using a backpacking stove.
* How to cook.
* Knots and lashings, and what you can do with them.
* The importance of helping others.
* Picking a good campsite.
* Teamwork.
* First aid skills.
* Being a good citizen.

But, enough: the best way is to come visit. Come on by a Troop meeting and meet the other kids. See what it's like.

I look forward to meeting you!
